<<<<<<< HEAD
### TODO
- None...open an issue for any feature request
=======
Please post feature requests in Issues. I will get back ASAP and add them if they stay true to Chromium OS's design. After all, this is a clone.

### Install on Ubuntu (though this will work on any platform that supports `lightdm-webkit-greeter`)
1. Install lightdm and the greeter by `sudo apt-get install lightdm lightdm-webkit-greeter`
2. Navigate to `/usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/`
3. Clone this repository there
4. Change the greeter to this theme in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf`

### Configuration
You can change the background by replacing the `wallpaper.jpg` with your own photo

**NOTE: IT MUST BE THE SAME FILE NAME**
